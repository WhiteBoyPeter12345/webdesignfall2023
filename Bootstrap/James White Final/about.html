        <p>Kyle was first introduced to fortnite by his father who told him about the "save the world" gamemode before
            the battle royale gamemode came out. Kyle started playing fortnite battle royale in 2017 when the gamemode
            first came out. His name on Fortnite is Bugha because thats what his grandfather called him when he was
            younger. As the game progressed, people got better, but Bugha was rising faster in skill than any other
            fortnite player out there.</p>
