        <p>Student athletes mental health has been going down significantlly and it has become a serious matter. All student athletes are at serious risk right now and if we don't do something about this than students will get issues that are serious and could cause great danger. Doing the things above could release the stress off of many student athletes and allows them to get enough sleep every night because that is the most important thing. Doing all of the above will protect students and their mental health and that is what we need.</p>
