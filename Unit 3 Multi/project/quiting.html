       <p>In the picture above, the chart is showing how almost 70% of both genders quit sports either because of not having fun or health problem. This shows that coaches are pushing student athletes too hard without knowing how much is going on in there lives which can cause people to leave sports for both of these reasons. As many as 15% of college athletes with scholarships quit their sport while in school. </p>

       <h2>Reasons Why</h2>
       <ul>
        <li>Itâ€™s not fun anymore</li>
        <li>Pressure to perform...and injuries that can result from overtraining due to that pressure to perform</li>
        <li>Their own perceptions of their own lack of competence at the sport</li>
        <li>Time demands</li>
        <br>
        <p>As you can see from the paragraph above, there are multiple reasons why athletes quit sports, and most of it comes from coach pushing too hard, time demands, and just simply not having fun anymore.</p>
